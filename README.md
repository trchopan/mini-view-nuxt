# mini-view

I have a spare iPad mini so I decided to build a View - Controller system that
I can play youtube video, show a clock, embed some string like cpu status, etc.

So [Mini View](https://mini-view.web.app) was born.

Enjoy!

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
